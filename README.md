# How?
The first intial batch of models (start - 12-28-24) was scraped via a simple C# console app I made, the new batch (12-29-24 - 06-09-25) was just downloaded manually using the Discord search built into the app. (`in:#ðŸ“¦ãƒ»models has:file`)  
# Why?
Plain and simple reason why was just to make it some what easier to find and download models for Aimmy or any other program that can use the models.
